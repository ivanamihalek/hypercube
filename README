TO COMPILE
--------------
cd to 10_objects and type make; the executable called hyper_c 
should appear one directory above (in the home directory for the code)
the code was tested on Linux and OS-X machines using gcc compiler
let us know if there is a problem on your machine/compiler

**************************************************************

TO RUN
--------------
for example: 

cd 11_tests/01_lac_pur
../../hyper cmd
   where cmd is an options file 
../../hyper_c -options 
   lists all aavailable options

output files  (<root name> can be changed in cmd file):
<root name>.score  - conservation for all groups, one discriminant score, 
                     one determinant score for the first group in the
                     groups file
<root name>.compare_scores - (with compare option in the cmd file) - list
                     of all implemented combinations of conservation and
                     overlap scores
<root name>.patchlog - gives the list of patched positions in the alignment
                    (the positions which are listed as "-" or "X" but 
		     counted as being equal to the aa type in the nearest
                     homologue)
 <root name>.patched.afa - shows what the "patched" alignment lokos like
                    -- to turn the patching off, delete or comment out (with "!")  
                     the lines with patch_sim_cutoff and patch_min_length kwds


**************************************************************

PROCESSING THE EXAMPLES
-----------------------
09_scripts contains some scripts for the analysis of output 
in compare mode, when many different combinations of scoring 
funcions are output (and difficult to read)


for example, in 11_tests/01_lac_pur

do 

../../09_scripts/compare_methods.pl Suckow.no_conserved.tp_list laci
where laci is the root of the output name as provided in the output file
to get the abbreviated version of the output, refering only to the
list of residues given in Suckow.no_conserved.tp_list

../../09_scripts/cube2roc.pl Suckow.no_conserved.tp_list Suckow.tn_list laci.comp_score rrl_dt jfl_dt
to get the ROC file for  rrl_dt jfl_dt methods 
(other names can be found in the header in laci.comp_score)
this will work provided you have a functional gnuplot and ps2pdf on your computer
it also produces *.auc file with the areas under the roc curves
if no method is specified, the script will process them all, which
results in an un-processable image, but the areas under are roc all
in one place


**************************************************************

VISUALIZATION OF RESULTS
-----------------------
one example provided:

cd  11_tests/03_lactalbumin_lysozyme 
../../hyper_c cmd
../../09_scripts/hc2pml.pl lalb.score 2fydA.pdb 2fydA.pml 
   to produce pymol script 
   to run it:
pymol 2fydA.pml 
	

../../09_scripts/hc2xls.pl lalb.score lalb.xls
  prodces a atbel in xls format, which contains
the colorbars for the cororin schemes usd in 
in pymol


Note: make sure to turn off the "compare" option
when doing the visualization, because the 
discriminant and determinant column in *.score file
are not guaranteed to be anything (reasonable) in 
that case.

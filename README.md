# Hypercube #

## Intro ##

Hypercube implements [several heuristic methods](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024382#s2) for detection of  regions of specialization on  protein sequence and structure. 
The purpose of such an exercise is, typically, to help in the rational design of single-site mutational experiments,
to estimate the impact of SNPs - inherited or arising in cancerous cells, or to guide computational docking; all for the special cases when there are several paralogues present in an organism, and we are interested in functional specificity for one of them.

To see the code at work on precompiled vertebrate sequences check out [CubeDB server](http://eopsf.org/cube/cube.html). 
To try it on your own set of seqeunces you can visit [Cube server](http://eopsf.org/cube/db/html/home.html). 
To compile an run locally, read on.
